--First, asks user size of puzzle to determine max value
   --Have some sort of way to exit calculator when user changes to new puzzle of dif size
--Should ask for all values at once? Or separate?
--Values are
   --operator (+,-,*,/) (Perhaps use numbered menu)
   --Number of Spaces (For now, subtraction and division default to 2)
      --Also, not accounting for if set is just one dimensional or two
      --Should first print no duplicate solutions
      --Then put a blank line in between showing duplicate solutions
   --Value of set

--Printing answers out may require an array?
   --Program could just print out solutions as it finds them
   --Can organize this so that the duplicate solutions are found in separate loop
